    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and plenty of
        melted cheese. This comforting and hearty meal is perfect for family gatherings or special occasions. The
        combination of flavors and textures makes it a favorite for both kids and adults alike.</p>
    <p>This recipe offers a simple yet delicious approach to making lasagna from scratch, ensuring that every bite is
        filled with cheesy goodness and savory sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Drain any excess fat, then stir in the marinara sauce
            and Italian seasoning. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce, then layer three noodles on top. Spread half of the
            ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a
            layer of meat sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or
            until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
